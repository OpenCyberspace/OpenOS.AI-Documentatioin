# Block
Block the core component AIOSv1 responsible for instantiating, serving, scaling and managing the AI inference or any general computational workload defined using AIOSv1 Instance SDK. A block can be scheduled on any cluster within the network of clusters that satisfies the resource requirements.

### Functionalities of a block:
1. Manages one or more instances of the AI or general computational workload. 
2. Spins up a load balancer (known as executor) which can be used for load balancing the tasks among the instances, the load balancing logic can be defined by the developer using load balancing policy.
3. Spins up Auto-scaler module as a side-car, this module monitors the instances and takes scaling decisions using Auto-scaling policy defined by the developer.
4. Provides APIs for executing management commands to update the configuration, query data from the auto-scaling and load balancing policies.
5. Provides APIs for fetching the metrics of instances and executor (load balancer)
6. Provides a health checker module as a side-car which is used to check the health of the instances and execute the developer defined health checker policy to check if the instances are healthy.
7. Provides a gRPC proxy server which will be used for exposing the block inference API to the outside world via the ingress.

## Architecture:

![block-components](../assets/block-arch.png)

**Services of block**:

1. **Executor**: Executor acts as a gateway for the block, tasks submitted to the block are load balanced using a load balancer policy, also implements executor metrics. Executors can't talk directly to the third party system, instead component instances are used as proxy.

2. **Mapper service**: Mapper service monitors for instance additions and removals periodically, when instances are added/removed, the new list of instances will be populated and sent to all the block's services, so they can maintain the updated state of instances.

3. **Auto-scaler**: Auto-scaler periodically monitors the metrics of all the instances, executes auto-scaler policy to determine if the instances needs to be scaled/down-scaled based on the workload demand. In case of third party system, auto-scaler can only scale the instances of the block but not the third party system, the third party system should take care of scaling on its own if its supported.

4. **Health checker**: This service periodically calls the health endpoint of all the instances of the block, runs health checker policy to determine if all the instances are healthy and takes the necessary action (defined in the policy) if anomalies are detected. In case of third party system, the instances must respond to the health check response on behalf of the third party system.

5. **Metrics system**: Metrics system is spread across the executor and instances, metrics system consumes the metrics and actively writes it to the local cluster metrics DB and the global metrics DBs.

6. **Instances**: The container image built using AIOS instance SDK will be instantiated as an instance of the block, in case the block is linked to a third party system, the instance should implement necessary code to interact with the third party system, i.e the instance must act as an abstraction between the executor and the third party system, when a task is submitted to the instance, instance converts the task data into a format suitable for third party system, communicates with the third party system, obtains the result, converts the result into task response accepted by AIOS system. Instance also calls the pre and post processing policy if the task is from a vDAG, it also pushes the output data to one or more side-cars if defined.

#### Block creation:
Blocks are created using the block specification (defined in detail in the parser documentation).

**For the creation flow, for the policies involved in block creation process - please refer to the Parser documentation, this document explains the Block components involved in the runtime like Load Balancer, Auto-scaling, health checks, metrics and management APIs.**

## Block inference API:
Block inference API can used to submit the inference request directly to the block, the block inference API uses gRPC protocol and defines a schema similar to the global inference server API. Here is the definition of the protobuf used for block inference:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

message InferenceMessage {
   bytes rpc_data = 1; 
}

message InferenceRespose {
     bool message = 1;
}

// Define the gRPC service
service InferenceProxy {
    rpc infer(InferenceMessage) returns (InferenceRespose);
}
```

For performance reasons, the proxy accepts a bytes data of the serialized protobuf structure defined below:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

message FileInfo {
    string metadata = 1; // JSON serialized metadata
    bytes file_data = 2; // File data
}

message AIOSPacket {
    string session_id = 1;      
    uint64 seq_no = 2;           // Sequence number
    bytes frame_ptr=3;          // frame_ptr data
    string data = 4;              // Data - json serialized
    double ts = 5;               // Timestamp  
    string output_ptr = 6;       // JSON serialized string for output pointer
    repeated FileInfo files = 7; // Array of file structures
}
```

The fields are as follows:

1. **`session_id`** *(Required)*  
   - A unique identifier representing an inference session.  
   - Enables stateful inference by allowing the block to track the session state.

2. **`seq_no`** *(Required)*  
   - Represents the sequence number of the task within the same `session_id`.  
   - The combination of `(session_id, seq_no)` uniquely identifies a task.  
   - This can be used to ensure inputs are processed in order.

3. **`frame_ptr`** *(Optional)*  
   - Used when the task requires a very large file as input.  
   - Stores file references in Frame DB instead of passing the file directly.  
   - A JSON string containing:  
     - **`framedb_id`**: The ID of the Frame DB.  
     - **`key`**: A unique key identifying the file in Frame DB.

4. **`data`** *(Required)*  
   - Contains the taskâ€™s input data.  
   - Typically a JSON string that acts as input for the block.

5. **`ts`** *(Required)*  
   - A floating-point UNIX epoch timestamp indicating when the task was created.

6. **`files`** *(Optional)*  
   - A list of small files (e.g., images, audio, PDFs) that the block can use during inference.  
   - Each file should comply with the `FileInfo` struct, containing:  
     - **`metadata`** (Optional): A JSON string with additional metadata about the file.  
     - **`file_data`**: The binary content of the file.

7. **`output_ptr`** *(Optional)*  
   - Used specifically for **graph inference** tasks.  
   - **Keep this field empty if you are doing direct block inference**

**Python example**:

```python
import grpc
import time
from protos import inference_pb2, inference_pb2_grpc, payload_pb2

def create_aios_packet():
    packet = payload_pb2.AIOSPacket()
    packet.session_id = "session-123"
    packet.seq_no = 1
    packet.data = '{"input": "Hello Block"}'
    packet.ts = time.time()

    # Optional: Add a small file
    file_info = payload_pb2.FileInfo()
    file_info.metadata = '{"type": "text", "description": "sample file"}'
    file_info.file_data = b"Sample file content"

    packet.files.append(file_info)

    return packet

def run():
    # Connect to the gRPC server
    channel = grpc.insecure_channel("<server-url>:50051")
    stub = inference_pb2_grpc.InferenceProxyStub(channel)

    # Serialize the payload
    aios_packet = create_aios_packet()
    serialized_data = aios_packet.SerializeToString()

    # Wrap it into InferenceMessage
    request = inference_pb2.InferenceMessage(rpc_data=serialized_data)

    # Send inference
    response = stub.infer(request)
    print("Inference response:", response.message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

## Block Load Balancer (Executor):
Block load balancer distributes the requests across multiple available instances of the AI/Computational module. The load balancing logic cannot be pre-defined and fixed since different types of AI/Computational workloads follow different latency, throughput, resource utilization patterns, hence the load balancing policy can be used to implement the custom load balancing logic appropriate for the given type of AI/Computational workloads. This load balancing policy should map the given input task to one of the available instances, data points like current block metrics, cluster metrics and the block configuration information will be provided to the load balancer policy.

Here is the basic structure of load balancer policy:

```python

## Block Auto-scaler:
Block auto-scaler is deployed as a side-car which triggers the auto-scaler policy periodically based on the interval defined during the block creation (check Block creation spec).

The auto-scaler policy can then use this data to decide whether new instances should be added or the current instances should be removed because they are no longer in use.

## Block health checker:
Block health checker is a side-car similar to auto-scaler that collects the health data of instances for fixed intervals, then calls the health checker policy to take decisions. The health checker policy can implement the suitable action required - For example - notifying the developer via Slack, calling failure policy executor server or executing a scale command via cluster controller gateway etc.

Here is the flow of health-checker:
1. Health check initiates at fixed intervals.
2. For each instance in the block, calls `http://{pod_ip}:18001/health` to obtain the health information with a timeout.
3. If the API responds with a non-200 status or the connection times-out, the instance is considered to be un-healthy.
4. Calls the policy with the health data of each instance passed as a list. 
5. The health check policy can decide to take action based on this health data.

```python
import requests

def call_failure_policy(api_url: str, failure_policy_id: str, inputs: dict, parameters: dict):
    try:
        url = f"{api_url}/executeFailurePolicy"

            data (dict): Input payload or command arguments.

        Returns:
            dict: A result dictionary containing the status and any relevant details.
        """
        # Implement custom management actions here
        pass

```

## Block Services:

When a block is created, an entry is created in the ingress of the cluster at the route: `/block/<block-id>`, thus the external parties can access the block using the URL:
```
http://<cluster-public-url>/block/<block-id>
```

For example, if the block-id is `block-771a8` and the `cluster-public-url` is `prasanna-home-cluster.clusters.aiosv1` then:
```
http://prasanna-home-cluster.clusters.aiosv1/block/block-771a8
``` 

Block exposes multiple services with multiple ingress routes and internal ports, here are the details of the various services:
Here's a table based on your provided ports and descriptions:

| **Purpose**     | **Internal Port** | **Ingress URL Suffix** | **Description**                                                |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Redis           | 6379             | N/A                     | Redis internal port for caching or coordination                |
| gRPC inference         | 50051            | /rpc                    | Executor proxy gRPC port used for submitting AI inference requests |
| Executor metrics         | 18000            | /metrics                | Executor metrics port                                          |

#### Executor Management:
Executor management server provides API to execute load balancer policy management commands as explained below:

**Endpoint:** `/mgmt`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**Description:**  

This endpoint handles various management actions for a load balancer system. The action is specified using the `mgmt_action` field in the JSON body.

**Example curl Command:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://<cluster-public-url>/block/<block-id>/executor/mgmt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "mgmt_action": "<action>",
    "mgmt_data": {}
  }'
```

#### Auto-scaler management:

**Endpoint:** `/mgmt`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**Description:**  

This endpoint is part of the auto-scaler management server. It accepts a management action and its associated data.

**Example curl Command:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://<cluster-public-url>/block/<block-id>/autoscaler/mgmt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "mgmt_action": "<action>",
    "mgmt_data": {}
  }'
```

#### Health checker management:

**Endpoint:** `/mgmt`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**Description:**  

This endpoint is part of the health-checker management server. It accepts a management action and its associated data.

**Example curl Command:**

curl -X POST http://<cluster-public-url>/block/<block-id>/health-checker/mgmt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "mgmt_action": "<action>",
    "mgmt_data": {}
  }'
```

#### Executor metrics:
The metrics of the executor can be obtained by calling the GET API on executor metrics endpoint, here is the curl command:

```bash
curl -X GET http://<cluster-public-url>/block/<block-id>/metrics
```

Following metrics are exported by executor:

| **Name**           | **Description**                                        |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `tasks_processed`  | Number of tasks processed by the executor               |
| `latency`          | Average end-to-end latency of tasks (in seconds)        |
