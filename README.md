# 🧠 **AIGr.id: Internet of Intelligence**
 
AIGrid represents a fundamental shift from siloed, monolithic AI to an **open, decentralized, and networked AI** paradigm.
 
Instead of building big, closed AI systems, OpenOS connects smaller, independent AI clusters into a Global AI Network.
 
 
🌐 **AIGr.id** is a decentralized network of interconnected AI components that coordinate to share data, perform tasks, and compose into higher-level collective intelligence.
 
---
 
## 🧩 Why AIGrid ?
 
- Built as **Global public infrastructure for AI** -  not owned or controlled by any single entity. <br>
- Works like **Commons** - shared, contributed to, and improved by a global community.
- **Sovereign** - communities to own, control, and govern their AI without external dependence.
- **Open Protocol** - Public set of standards that define how objects and actors interact across the network. Promoting Interoperability, coordination, transparency and extensibility.

⚙️ AIGr.id is **Powered by [AIOS (OpenOS.AI)](https://aigr.id)** — **A decentralized AI Operating System** for distributed AI networks.
 
**OpenOS.AI is 100% open source and community-driven.**

## ✨ What Can You Do with OpenOS?

- Connect Kubernetes clusters into a **global compute network**
- Deploy your AI models (like LLMs or vision models) as reusable **Blocks**
- Deploy **multiple blocks on same GPU** to save resources
- Define workflows using **vDAGs** (virtual Directed Acyclic Graphs)
- Share and re-use **models, data, blocks and compute infrastructure**
- Use **Python policies** to control how the network behaves
- Extend your Blocks with third-party tools via init containers
- Collect and use **metrics** to make smart decisions and observe the network

## 🎯 Our Objectives

At OpenOS, we’re building more than just a platform — we’re designing the foundation for a **plural, sovereign AI future**. Our mission is to create AI infrastructure that is:

- **Open** — accessible, inspectable, and modifiable by anyone  
- **Decentralized** — not controlled by any single company, cloud, or country  
- **Composable** — built from reusable, modular components called **Blocks**  
- **Governable** — enforceable policies built in as first-class citizens  
- **Interoperable** — works with your own models, data, and systems  
- **Collaborative** — made by and for a global community of contributors  

We want to make it easy to:

- Run large AI models (like LLMs and Vision AI) across many machines  
- Share AI, compute and data infra across organizations  
- Define custom behaviors through simple Python policies  
- Enable new forms of AI collaboration — cross-team, cross-cloud, and cross-border  
- Build networks that anyone can join, contribute to, and benefit from
